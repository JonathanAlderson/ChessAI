# ChessAI
A very old attempt at a Chess AI

This was made back in 6th form aswell.
It was a very large project for me, with 
lots of restarts. Although, I never got 
anything good out of it in the end. I learned
a lot about how these things work, and
the optimisations that are done on them 
so that they can run.
So, in some senses it was a success.

I had it hooked up to play against real people
on lichess.com, using computer vision
to read the positions and use PyAutoGUI
to input its moves.

I managed to beat my friend with this bot once.
